## 🔑 Step 1: Create Your Supabase Project

1. Log in to [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com).
2. Click **New Project** and choose your organization.
3. Configure the project:
   - **Name**: `Red Sea Excursions` (or your company name).
   - **Database Password**: Generate and store a strong password.
   - **Region**: Choose a region close to your target audience (e.g. Frankfurt, London, or Bahrain).
   - **Pricing Plan**: Free tier or Pro tier.
4. Click **Create new project** and wait ~60 seconds for provisioning.

---

## 🌐 Step 2: Environment Variables & Connection Setup

### Option A: Via `.env` (Recommended for Local Dev & Production Builds)
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with:

```bash
# Supabase API Credentials (Project Settings > API)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://<your-project-id>.supabase.co"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

### Option B: In-Browser Credential Manager (Instant, Zero Container Restart)
The application includes an in-browser key manager located in the Admin CMS:
1. Navigate to `/admin` in your browser.
2. In the sidebar, select **Settings**.
3. Under **PostgreSQL & Storage Backend**, enter your **Supabase URL** and **Anon Key**.
4. Click **Test Connection & Save Credentials**.
5. The system tests live query capability with `public.destinations` and activates the live database instantly.

> **Security Note**: Only the public `anon` key should ever be used on the client. Never provide the `service_role` secret to the frontend.

---

## 📜 Step 3: Run the Complete Schema Migration

The migration file is located at:
```
/supabase/migrations/20260922000000_phase4_schema.sql

     ```
3. Email Templates (Optional):
   - You can customize the confirmation email under **Authentication > Email Templates** to feature your logo and brand colors (`#0A6C74`).

---

## 👑 Step 6: Promote Your Administrator Account

To access the CMS at `/admin`, an account must have the `admin` role in `public.profiles`.

1. Go to your website at `/register` or `/login` and create an account using your email (e.g. `diamond.entertainment70@gmail.com`).
2. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** > **SQL Editor**.
3. Run the helper function:
   ```sql
   SELECT public.set_admin_role_by_email('diamond.entertainment70@gmail.com');
   ```
4. **Expected Output**:
   ```
   Success: Account diamond.entertainment70@gmail.com (User ID: ...) is now an active administrator.
   ```
5. You can now log in at `/admin/login` or click **Admin CMS** in the website footer.

---

## 📦 Step 7: Verify Storage Buckets

The migration automatically creates all three required buckets:

| Bucket Name | Access Level | Allowed MIME Types | Max Size | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tour-media` | Public | Images (`jpeg`, `png`, `webp`, `avif`) & Videos (`mp4`, `webm`) | 25 MB | Tour galleries, hero banners, and promotional media |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Diagnostics

### 1. `PGRST205: Could not find the table '...' in the schema cache`
- **Cause**: The PostgreSQL tables have not been created yet in Supabase.
- **Fix**: Open the Supabase **SQL Editor**, paste the contents of `/supabase/migrations/20260922000000_phase4_schema.sql`, and click **Run**.

### 2. `infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "profiles"`
- **Cause**: An older RLS policy evaluated `public.profiles` using a subquery that called `public.profiles` again.
- **Fix**: The migration uses the non-recursive `public.is_admin()` function with `SECURITY DEFINER` and statement-level `(SELECT auth.uid()) = id` caching. If upgrading an existing database, run `/supabase/migrations/20260928000000_fix_admin_auth_rls.sql`.

### 3. `Access Denied: Your account is currently assigned the "customer" role`
- **Cause**: Your user account exists, but has not yet been promoted to administrator.
- **Fix**: Run in the Supabase SQL Editor:
  ```sql
  SELECT public.set_admin_role_by_email('your-email@domain.com');
  ```

### 4. CORS or Network Errors When Calling Supabase
- **Cause**: Missing or incorrect `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` format.
- **Fix**: Ensure your URL follows `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co` without trailing slashes.

### 5. Images Failing to Upload in Admin CMS
- **Cause**: Storage bucket `tour-media` is missing or upload policy is restricted.
- **Fix**: Verify in **Storage** that `tour-media` is marked as a **Public bucket**, or re-run Section 6 of the migration script.
